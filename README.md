# Android Sliding Emoji Keyboard
Our Sliding Emoji Keyboard app.

Basic keyboard application that allows you to insert emojis. It has a settings activity that allows you to switch between EmojiOne and EmojiOne Black and white emojis.

### Download

The current version of that app is a single keyboard, and can be downloaded from the attached [APK](emoji-keyboard-release.apk) or you can download the app from the [google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=inc.flide.emojiKeyboard), if you would rather not just clone the repo and build it.
