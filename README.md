# Android Sliding Emoji Keyboard
Our Sliding Emoji Keyboard app.

Basic keyboard application that allows you to insert emojis. It has a settings activity that allows you to switch between iOS and Android style emojis.

### Download

The current version of this repo isn't (and won't) be on the Play Store. I have 3 legacy versions out on the Play Store that support features of our older apps and shouldn't be updated/removed for that reason. They can be found here:

[Unlocker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.klinker.android.emoji_keyboard)

[Android Emoji Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.klinker.android.emoji_keyboard_trial)

[iOS Emoji Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.klinker.android.emoji_keyboard_trial_ios)

The current version of that app, which houses the iOS and Android emojis, in a single keyboard, can be downloaded from the attached [APK](emoji-keyboard.apk), if you would rather not just clone the repo and build it.
